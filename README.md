# NotDotBlur 

This is a completely rebuilt model of the existing dot art high-resolution software NotDotBlur,
now utilizing the excellent NeutralinoJS library.
It is lightweight, fast, and leverages web technologies.
The binary size was ultimately reduced to **700KB**,
and even the standard model is only about **2.5MB**.

## Note
This software is written in python as per the source code, but can be started without a python environment since all necessary libraries are included in a single exe file.
The developer is still very inexperienced, so some parts may be incomplete. The In that case, please send it to me in an issue and I will do the best I can.
